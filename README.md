# Transformer Lab

A home for my notes, code, and reflections as I step through Deep Learning by Goodfellow et al. and Build a LLM from Scratch by Raschka, as well as conduct interpretabilty experiments.

## `writing`

### `hypotheses.md`

This file tracks what I currently think might be true, and preserves the graveyard of ideas that died.

### `claims.md`

This file contains things I can now defend with evidence. These are hypotheses that have survived contact with evidence and graduated to claims.
