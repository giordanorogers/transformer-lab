# Hypotheses Log
_Last updated: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}_

This document tracks:
- Active hypotheses I currently believe might be true
- Dormant hypotheses that need more evidence
- Rejected hypotheses that failed under experiment

## 1. Active Hypotheses (Currently Believed / Being Tested)

### H{{NN}} — {{Short descriptive title}}
- **Status:** Active
- **Introduced on:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
- **Source:** {{ e.g., "From Day 07 interp session on attention heads" }}

**Statement (falsifiable):**  
> {{ Clear, testable claim about internal mechanism }}

**Why I believe this now:**  
- {{ Key results, intuitions, or patterns supporting it }}
- {{ Reference to interp day files if relevant }}

**What would falsify this:**  
- {{ Specific experiment or outcome that would refute it }}

**Next planned test:**  
- {{ Concrete intervention to run next time }}

## 2. Dormant / Underspecified Hypotheses
_(Interesting, but currently too vague or too costly to test.)_

### H{{NN}} — {{Short descriptive title}}
- **Status:** Dormant
- **Introduced on:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

**Statement:**  
> {{ Vague or partially specified belief }}

**Why it’s interesting:**  
- {{ Why you think this could matter }}

**What’s missing to test it:**  
- {{ Data, tooling, model scale, time, etc. }}

## 3. Rejected Hypotheses (Killed by Evidence)
_This section is just as important as the active one._

### H{{NN}} — {{Short descriptive title}}
- **Status:** Rejected
- **Introduced on:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
- **Rejected on:** {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

**Original statement:**  
> {{ What you originally believed }}

**How it failed:**  
- {{ What experiment killed it }}
- {{ Key metric or plot that contradicted it }}

**What I learned instead:**  
- {{ Updated belief or rule of thumb }}

## 4. Meta-Notes on My Current Hypothesis Style
_(Updated occasionally.)_

- {{ Am I over-crediting attention? }}
- {{ Am I underestimating MLPs? }}
- {{ Am I biasing toward clean modular stories? }}
